Package Name: activity
Package Path: com.eventappucsd.activity

Description: A package designed to contain all the code for Activities that are created. Hypothetically
    there should only be 2 classes here: namely the MainActivity and the sub-activity AddEvent.
    More classes may be added as needed. Classes that are added here should extend the parent class
    AppCompatActivity from the android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity package.
